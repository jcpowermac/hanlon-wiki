Because of the nature of different servers and differences in their support for both PXE and iPXE you may run into issues with the default PXE/iPXE configuration of Occam. The examples shown below make use of the configuration options available in the ISC DHCP server.  For other DHCP servers, the actual configuration options that should be used may vary.

## Optional Configuration - Skip PXE Menu

Most installations of Occam will use the direct PXE loading hook with Occam. This method involves setting the next-server and filename DHCP options to point to your Occam server and the 'pxelinux.0' file respectively. This process uses the burned-in PXE command code to load Occam's SYSLINUX pxeconfig.0 code which in turn presents a VGA-style menu. This menu is set to boot to Occam by default but allows the option to bypass Occam completely. If Occam is used to boot the node, then an iPXE kernel is loaded (ipxe.lkrn) and that iPXE kernel hooks into the Occam API for further instructions.

This process does 2 chain loads: the first from burned in PXE to Occam's PXELINUX and the second from PXELINUX to iPXE. For some network cards this causes issues. You can reduce this to 1 chain load by removing the PXE bypass menu and directly loading into Occam. In order to skip the PXE bypass menu, you will need to obtain the undionly.kpxe file, which can be downloaded [directly from ipxe.org](http://boot.ipxe.org/undionly.kpxe). You will then place this file in the standard TFTP folder on your Occam server (/var/lib/tftpboot for an Ubuntu instance) and modify your DHCP server configuration to use this (undionly.kpxe) image. To highlight the differences between these two configurations, both are shown below for those users who are using the ISC DHCP server (the default configuration that is used if Occam is installed using the PuppetLabs Occam Module).  First, this is the ISC DHCP config that uses the default (pxelinux.0) kernel:

```
subnet 192.168.99.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.99.100 192.168.99.200;
  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
  option broadcast-address 192.168.99.255;
  option routers 192.168.99.10;
  filename "pxelinux.0"; # default loading
  next-server 192.168.99.10;
}
```

While this configuration uses an if/else to bypass the VGA-style default boot menu and directly chain load to iPXE and Occam:

```
subnet 192.168.99.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.99.100 192.168.99.200;
  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
  option broadcast-address 192.168.99.255;
  option routers 192.168.99.10;
  if exists user-class and option user-class = "iPXE" {
      filename "occam.ipxe"; # we are in an iPXE kernel and load static script
  } else {
      filename "undionly.kpxe"; # we are in burned in PXE and load iPXE kernel
  }
  next-server 192.168.99.10;
}
```

The second configuration (or something like it that is appropriate for your DHCP server's configuration) should be used in cases where multiple chain loading issues are a problem (as is the case for some Broadcom cards).

### Note (for users of dnsmasq)

It should be noted here that those who are using a dnsmasq instance as a DHCP server can also configure their dnsmasq instance to skip the VGA-based PXE bypass menu used in Occam by default (and resolve this same issue).  The dnsmasq configuration file does not support the same sort of `if ... { } else { }` syntax that is supported in the ISC DHCP server's configuration file, so the configuration file fix shown above for the ISC DHCP server will not work for dnsmasq, however dnsmasq does support the concept of tagging (and these tags can be used to create the same effect).  Here is a snippet from a dnsmasq configuration file that uses tags to resolve this same issue:

```
# tag any machine who's DHCP user-class string includes
# the substring "iPXE" with the tag "ipxe"
dhcp-userclass=set:ipxe,iPXE

# then use this tag to select the "image" to use during the boot process
# (occam.ipxe for iPXE user-class strings, undionly.kpxe for everything else)
dhcp-boot=tag:ipxe,occam.ipxe
dhcp-boot=tag:!ipxe,undionly.kpxe
```

So, by simply adding this snippet to their dnsmasq configuration file (in place of the `dhcp-boot=pxelinux.0` line they are likely using out of the box) dnsmasq users can also resolve this dual chain loading issue (which can lead to some fairly to cryptic errors when PXE-booting a node using for network cards like the Broadcom NetXtreme II card).

## Optional Configuration - Support for Older Cards

A last resort option may be to burn iPXE kernel directly to your network cards. See the instructions here on the iPXE documentation: http://ipxe.org/howto/romburning
